CoC Alumni Hackathon
====================

A Tale of Mediocrity
--------------------

Once upon a time, the CoC decided to run a hackathon. They gathered the best and brightest alumni across the land, from the very corners of the earth, and brought them together for the first-ever Alumni Hackathon. These wise leaders and prodigies were to lead teams of young and inexperienced CS undergrads, who werenâ€™t ready to face the horrors of the real world, and bestow upon them the very knowledge they'd need to excel outside of the classroom.

Unfortunately, they fucked up *big time* and didn't find enough alumni, so some of the upperclassmen (that were hoping to receive extremely valuable industry-mentorship) were handed a team of first and second years to babysit.

Sucks to be you, boys. Now let's go fuck some shit up.
