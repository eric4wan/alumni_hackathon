CoC Alumni Hackathon
====================

A Tale of Mediocrity
--------------------

Once upon a time, the CoC decided to run a hackathon. They gathered the best and brightest alumni they could, and brought them together in a monumental first. These wise leaders and geniuses were to lead teams of young and impressionable CS undergrads and bestow upon them the very knowledge they'd need to excel outside of the classroom.

Unfortunately, they fucked up and didn't find enough alumni. So they took some of the upperclassmen that were hoping to receive extremely valuable industry-mentorship, and handed them some first and second years to babysit.

Sucks to be you, boys. Now let's go fuck some shit up.
